                    <p>My name is Abu Taher Sarker. I'm a Front End Developer using ReactJs. I describe myself as a passionate developer who loves coding, open source, and the web platform ❤️.</p><br />
                    <p>Aside from my Study, I like to create and contribute to open source projects. That helps me to learn a ton of new stuff, grow as a developer and support other open source projects. Also I enjoy writing technical things ✍️ at my blog. In my free time you can find me at Cricket Field , at the gym 🏋️‍♂️, at the beach 🏖 or on tech meetups and conferences.</p>
